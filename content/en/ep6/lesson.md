What do you think about what you just read? Is it incredible? But, sometimes, a simple oversight of where we put our data is enough to let our bank account balance drop sharply. Unfortunately not all sites keep and transmit data in a secure way (i.e sites whose URL starts with http://...), so they are easily stolen if intercepted. You should always checl the security of the site you are connecting to, both for the transmission (if the URL starts with HTTPS://...) and for the thrutfulness of the site itself (unfortunately lately there are a lot of malicious sites using secure URLs).
