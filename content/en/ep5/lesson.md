Free stuff is awesome, you can save a lot of money and time. But not always they are secure. The risk of spreading sensitive data to unauthorized users is around the corner. Before using a File Sharing service found surfing on the Internet, ask your organization if it has already tested and accepted and certified. Otherwise, verify with you IT supervisor if your file sharing is applicable and remember, encrypt data before sending them!
